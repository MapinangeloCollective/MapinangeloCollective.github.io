  <h2>Blanding's Turtle Habitat Analysis<br>in Prince Edward County, Ontario</h2>
</div>

<div class="Proposaldiv">
    <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
    <p>Blanding's Turtles are a semi-aquatic, long-lived reptile species that has been observed to travel up to 6 km to find suitable nesting habitat. Blanding's Turtle populations in Ontario and all over Canada are declining due to a multitude of threats and are listed as a Threatened species in both provincial and federal legislation. The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) is a private, non-profit organization and is a leader for land conservation in Canada. One of the areas that NCC helps to protect, and steward is the South Shore of Prince Edward County (PEC), which is a globally significant Important Bird and Biodiversity area. NCC is working to implement the Ontario Government's Recovery Strategy for Blanding's Turtles on the South Shore along with partner organizations and private landowners. To inform their management plans, NCC is interested in a solution that will provide potential locations of Blandingâ€™s Turtle wetland and nesting habitat on the South Shore. This will allow NCC to measure distances between wetland and nesting habitat in order to prioritize certain areas, understand whose management these areas fall under, and share the information with relevant partners. To meet NCC's needs, Mapinangelo Collective will provide a custom file geodatabase with the relevant project data, an ArcGIS Experience Builder web application to cartographically present the project, and a final report detailing the process and results of the project. The project team, Mapinangelo Collective, is excited to complete this culminating project and contribute to NCC's conservation efforts.</p>

  <p>NCC is a private, non-profit organization, leading the way for land conservation in Canada. Starting in 1962 with a small group of naturalists that wanted to promote conservation in Canada, NCC has grown considerably and now has initiatives taking place in every province and territory. NCC's goal is to connect people with nature and create a world where both can thrive (NCC, 2022).

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The locations of turtles are considered sensitive informtion, therefore the NCC-provided data and project results are confidential. A mock dataset was created and a copy of the web app using the fake data is being presented for the the Fleming College GIS Open House. To create the mock dataset, the feature classes were copied and the ELC codes were shuffled so that the codes do not accurately represent the land cover in the study area.</p>
