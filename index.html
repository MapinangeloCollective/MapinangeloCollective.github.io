  <h2> Blandings Turtle Habitat Analysis <br>in Prince Edward County</h2>

    <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
    <p>Blanding’s Turtles are a semi-aquatic, long-lived reptile species distinguishable by their bright yellow chin. They generally live in wetlands and have been observed to travel up to 6 kilometers to find suitable nesting habitat. Blanding’s Turtle populations in Ontario and all over Canada are declining due to a multitude of threats and are listed as Threatened in both provincial and federal legislation. The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) is a private, non-profit organization and is a leader for land conservation in Canada. One of the areas that NCC helps to protect and steward is the South Shore of Prince Edward County (PEC), which is a globally significant Important Bird and Biodiversity area (IBA). NCC is working to implement the Ontario Government’s Recovery Strategy for Blanding’s Turtles on the South Shore along with partner organizations and private landowners. To inform their management plans, NCC is interested in a solution that provides the locations of potential Blanding’s Turtle wetland and nesting habitat on the South Shore in a format that is low-maintenance and intuitive to use. This allows NCC to easily view and measure distances between wetland and nesting habitat in order to prioritize certain areas, understand whose management these areas fall under, and share the information with relevant partners. The project team, Mapinangelo Collective, has developed a solution that satisfies NCC’s needs.  
<br>
<br> Mapinangelo Collective has provided NCC with three deliverables: a file geodatabase with relevant project data, an interactive ArcGIS Experience Builder web application, and a final report detailing the process and results of the project. The project was completed over the course of seven weeks in five phases: Data Acquisition & Pre-Processing, Database Creation, Spatial Analysis, Visualization, and Final Presentation. The project data was acquired from NCC, as well as the Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) 3.0 and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Annual Crop Inventory (2021). An NCC biologist was consulted to categorize Ecological Land Classification (ELC) and crop classification land cover into four categories of Turtle Habitat potential: Wetland Habitat, Blanding’s Turtle Nesting Habitat, General Turtle Nesting Habitat, or No Turtle Habitat. The data was processed in ArcGIS Pro 2.9.2, stored and symbolized in ArcGIS Online, and used in the configuration of the Experience Builder web app. The web app was designed for users with minimal Geographic Information System (GIS) experience. The maps display turtle habitat information and relevant boundaries with intuitive functionalities, while multiple fixed windows provide project context and supplementary information. The project deliverables successfully fulfill NCC’s requirements. This project is intended to provide NCC with an easily accessible GIS resource for Blanding’s Turtle habitat in PEC, but is not a comprehensive scientific study on Blanding’s Turtle habitat suitability. Mapinangelo Collective hopes that this project will help with NCC’s future management plans and make positive contributions to Blanding’s Turtle conservation in PEC.</p>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p> Since the locations of turtles are considered sensitive informtion, the NCC-provided data and project reuslts are confidential. A mock dataset was created and a copy of the web app using the fake data is being presented for the the Fleming College GIS Open House. To create the mock dataset, the feature classes were copied and the ELC codes were shuffled so that the codes do not accurately represent the land cover in the study area.</p>
