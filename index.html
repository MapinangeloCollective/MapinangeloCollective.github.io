  <h2>Blanding's Turtle Habitat Analysis<br>in Prince Edward County, Ontario</h2>
</div>

<div class="Proposaldiv">
    <h3>Project Abstract</h3>
    <p>Blanding's Turtles are a semi-aquatic, long-lived reptile species distinguishable by their bright yellow chin. 
      They generally live in wetlands and have been observed to travel up to 6 kilometers to find suitable nesting habitat. 
      Blanding's Turtle populations are declining due to a multitude of threats and are listed as Threatened in both provincial 
      and federal legislation. The Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) helps to protect and steward the South Shore of Prince Edward County (PEC), 
      which is a globally significant Important Bird and Biodiversity area (IBA). NCC is working to implement the Ontario 
      Government's Recovery Strategy for Blanding's Turtles along with partner organizations and private landowners. To inform 
      their management plans, NCC is interested in a solution that provides locations of potential Blanding's Turtle wetland and nesting habitat 
      on the South Shore in a format that is low-maintenance and intuitive to use. This allows NCC to easily view and measure distances between 
      wetland and nesting habitat in order to prioritize certain areas, understand whose management these areas fall under, and share the information 
      with relevant partners. The project team, Mapinangelo Collective, has developed a solution that satisfies NCC's needs. 
<br>
<br> Mapinangelo Collective has provided NCC with three deliverables: a file geodatabase with relevant project data, an interactive ArcGIS Experience 
Builder web application, and a final report detailing the process and results of the project. The project was completed over the course of seven weeks 
in five phases: Data Acquisition & Pre-Processing, Database Creation, Spatial Analysis, Visualization, and Final Presentation. The project data was 
acquired from NCC, as well as the Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) 3.0 and the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) Annual 
Crop Inventory (2021). An NCC biologist was consulted to categorize Ecological Land Classification (ELC) and crop classification land cover into four 
categories of Turtle Habitat potential: Wetland Habitat, Blanding's Turtle Nesting Habitat, General Turtle Nesting Habitat, or No Turtle Habitat. The data 
was processed in ArcGIS Pro 2.9.2, stored and symbolized in ArcGIS Online, and used in the configuration of the Experience Builder web app. The web app was 
designed for users with minimal Geographic Information System (GIS) experience. The maps display turtle habitat information and relevant boundaries with 
intuitive functionalities, while multiple fixed windows provide project context and supplementary information. The project deliverables successfully fulfill 
NCC's requirements. This project is intended to provide NCC with an easily accessible GIS resource for Blanding's Turtle habitat in PEC, but is not a comprehensive 
scientific study on Blanding's Turtle habitat suitability. Mapinangelo Collective hopes that this project will help with NCC's future management plans and make 
positive contributions to Blanding's Turtle conservation in PEC.</p>

  <h3>The Client</h3>

    <img src="images/NCC.png" alt='Exp Build' width="300" height="100%">
  </a>
  <p>NCC is a private, non-profit organization, leading the way for land conservation in Canada. Starting in 1962 with a small group of naturalists that wanted to promote conservation in Canada, NCC has grown considerably and now has initiatives taking place in every province and territory. NCC's goal is to connect people with nature and create a world where both can thrive (NCC, 2022).

  <h3>The Study Area</h3>
  <p>Our Study area is Prince Edward County South Shore. Prince Edward County (PEC) is an island on the north side of Lake Ontario south of Belleville, Ontario. The South Shore of PEC is a globally significant Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) and is home to many species at risk. Southern PEC is abundant in wetlands, shrublands, and alvars, making it suitable habitat for Blandingâ€™s Turtles </p>

    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>The locations of turtles are considered sensitive informtion, therefore the NCC-provided data and project results are confidential. A mock dataset was created and a copy of the web app using the fake data is being presented for the the Fleming College GIS Open House. To create the mock dataset, the feature classes were copied and the ELC codes were shuffled so that the codes do not accurately represent the land cover in the study area.</p>
