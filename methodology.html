  <h2>Project Methodology</h2>
</div>

<div class="Proposaldiv">
    <h3>Data Aquisition & Pre-Processing</h3>
    <p>The first phase of the project involved acquiring and parsing through land cover and boundary spatial data from NCC and open-source data.
      SOLRIS and AAFC data was used to fill the areas outside of the NCC properties. The following is our workflow in how we processed this data into a readable and clear format.

  <h3>Database Creation</h3>
  <p>After the data was aquired it was organized into a clean file geodatabase for the NCC to use in the future. The data was organized into 5 feature datasets.
    Any information the was not nessecary to the project was removed.

  <h3>Spatial Analysis</h3>
  <p>Blandings Turtles travel on average 100 metres to 250 metres from their wetland habitat to their nesting habitat. We decided to create a layer for our map that shows the nesting 
    habitat within that range from the wetland habitat. The workflow on how this was done is shown below.

  <h3>Cartographic Presentation/Visualization</h3>
  <p>The web application was built using ArcGIS Expeirence builder. The application was design to be easily used by any user. Below is a screenshot of the app when it is forst open.</p>
